# Oxide and Friends: March 24th, 2025

## Raiding the minibar

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/R3FBuE2nJx4).

Much of the work at Oxide goes into hardware and software used to build and
test the eventual product. Bryan and Adam were joined by Ian, Doug, and
Nathanael to talk about "Minibar", a rig for connecting up an Oxide server
(code name: Gimlet) for manufacturing and internal use. Triumphs and
catastrophes including stabbing a connector with a guide pin and bringup
mishaps!

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
speakers included
Ian Sobering,
Doug Wibben, and
[Nathanael Huffman](https://hachyderm.io/@SyntheticGate),

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this
