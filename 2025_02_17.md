## A Half-Century of Silicon Valley with Randy Shoup

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/-9WuDTGXMVc).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
our special guest was
[Randy Shoup](https://bsky.app/profile/randyshoup.bsky.social).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
