# Oxide and Friends: May 5th, 2025

## Solutions software engineering with Matthew Sanabria

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/uY6YgNc7vkY).

Matthew Sanabria joins Bryan and Adam to talk about his role at Oxide--Solutions Software Engineer--and how it fits in with engineering, sales, support and marketing. It takes everyone in Busytown! Sound good? Apply!

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleague,
[Matthew Sanabria](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:brfbmfg2d2ug37sxe7yehocc).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:
