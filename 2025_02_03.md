## AI Disruption: DeepSeek and Cerebras

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by
