## A Happy Day For Rust

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/zCTR5_FM4uA).

Recently a change to a utility in the Rust toolchain changed behavior in a way
that impacted users. Rather than being a story of frustration and aspersions,
it was a story of a community working... and working well together! Bryan and
Adam were joined by Dirkjan Ochtman (of the rustup team) and Steve Klabnik to
discuss.

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by special guest,
[Dirkjan Ochtman](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:htsnmeozwqcgo3ar7z65azjr),
and treasured colleague,
[Steve Klabnik](https://bsky.app/profile/steveklabnik.com).
