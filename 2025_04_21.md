# Oxide and Friends: April 21st, 2025

## Bringing up Cosmo

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/SVFa-W3cH-g).

Oxide is bringing up its next generation server. To discuss the (amazingly smooth) bringup process, Bryan and Adam were joined by members of the oxide team. Tales of adversity, re-work, un-re-work, and triumph!

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by Oxide colleagues
[Nathanael Huffman](https://hachyderm.io/@SyntheticGate),
Ian Sobering,
[Matt Keeter](https://hachyderm.io/@mjk),
and Aaron Hartwig.

We mentioned quite a few terms! Here's a helpful guide:
- Cosmo - Oxide’s next-generation sled (currently in development) with an AMD Turin CPU
- Gimlet - Oxide’s current-generation sled with an AMD Milan CPU
- Turin - AMD Epyc 9005 Series
- Milan - AMD Epyc 7003 Series
- Genoa - AMD Epyc 9004 Series (Oxide chose to skip this generation)
- Sequencing - the precise control of when power rails are energized throughout a PCB
- Sled - One of the (max 32) computers in an Oxide rack; a custom form-factor optimized for power and cooling efficiency
- IBC - Intermediate Bus Converter (Our 54VDC -> 12VDC converter)
- RoT - Root of Trust
- SP - Service Processor, the small computer (running Hubris) that allows for low-level control
- Ignition - An even lower-level control network for power management (including power of the SP)
- Ruby - The AMD reference platform (Oxide has used this to prepare Cosmo software in advance of bringup)
- DC-SCM - https://www.opencompute.org/documents/ocp-dc-scm-spec-rev-1-0-pdf and OpenCompute standard form factor.
- Grapefruit - OCP DC-SCM form-factor board with our SP, RoT, and FPGA on it, used to replace the OCP DC-SCM baseboard management controller in the Ruby platform.
- Cadence - Software Oxide previously used for PCB design
- Altium - Software Oxide now uses for PCB design
- Hubris - Oxide’s embedded operating system, run on the SP and RoT
- Humility - The Hubris debugger
- PLM - Product Lifecycle Management – a class of software used for managing hardware BOMs
- BOM - Bill of Materials – the components required to build a hardware product
- RFK - Our colleague, Robert Keith (to distinguish him from our other colleague, Robert, and our former colleague, Keith)
- FPGA - Field Programmable Gate Array – Also referred to as “soft logic” – effectively programmable hardware
- ILA - Integrated Logic Analyzer
- JTAG - A debugging interface for various processors
- UART - A serial port or connection

Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this

We'd love to have you join us, as we always love to hear from new speakers!
