## AI, Materials, and Fraud with Ben Shindel

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/qRjRkYs0x9k).

Late in 2024, an economics paper captured the attention of the world. AI, it claimed, had a tremendous impact on materials research, disproportionally benefitted the most productive, and--sadly--reduced job statisfaction. It now appears that the results are entirely fabricated! Ben Shindel joins Bryan and Adam to discuss.

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by special guest
[Ben Shindel](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:xriuhej4aiwbphj7vsdx3p62).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Ben's blog: AI, Materials, and Fraud, Oh My!](https://thebsdetector.substack.com/p/ai-materials-and-fraud-oh-my)
- [OxF: Theranos, Silicon Valley, and the March Madness of Tech Fraud](https://share.transistor.fm/s/002528dc)
- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this
