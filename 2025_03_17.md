# Oxide and Friends: March 17th, 2025

## Lip-Bu Tan's Intel

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/-sYvYYSxz2Y).

Intel has a new CEO! And it's Lip-Bu Tan. We had assumed it would not be
Lip-Bu--he was such a clear front-runner that the more time passed the less
likely it seemed it would be him... and yet! Bryan and Adam were joined by
Reuter's Max Cherney to discuss.

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
our esteemed guest was
[Max Cherney](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:3c2blhcwiud3fijiaignvxt7);
we were also joined by
[Bryan Russett](https://bsky.app/profile/bryan.run),
