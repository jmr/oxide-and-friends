# Oxide and Friends: June 2nd, 2025

## AI Discourse with Steve Klabnik

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/rOIDw38CEu8).

Last week, our colleague (and frequent Oxide and Friends guest) Steve Klabnik made some new friends on the Internet with a blog entry on AI discourse. Bryan and Adam were joined by Steve to try to de-polarize the discussion a little.


In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by special guest,
[Steve Klabnik](https://bsky.app/profile/steveklabnik.com),
and valued listener,
Julian Giamblanco (aka "Oatmealdealer").

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:
