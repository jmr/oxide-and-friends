# Oxide and Friends: June 2nd, 2025

## AI Discourse with Steve Klabnik

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording](https://youtu.be/Rpan3XUT3AE).

Last week, our colleague (and frequent Oxide and Friends guest) Steve Klabnik made some new friends on the Internet with a blog entry on AI discourse. Bryan and Adam were joined by Steve to try to de-polarize the discussion a little.


In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://bsky.app/profile/bcantrill.bsky.social) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://bsky.app/profile/ahl.bsky.social),
we were joined by special guest,
[Steve Klabnik](https://bsky.app/profile/steveklabnik.com),
and valued listener,
Julian Giamblanco (aka "Oatmealdealer").

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Steve's blog post: I am disappointed in the AI discourse](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/i-am-disappointed-in-the-ai-discourse/)
- [OxF: A Baseball Startup with Paul Freedman and Bryan Carmel](https://share.transistor.fm/s/a8b34a66) (The Ballers)
- [OxF: Adversarial Machine Learning with Nicholas Carlini](https://share.transistor.fm/s/50ec7c99)
- [OxF: Hiring Processes with Gergely Orosz](https://share.transistor.fm/s/ac83d63e) ("the RFD 3 podcast episode")
- [OxF: AI Disruption: DeepSeek and Cerebras](https://share.transistor.fm/s/061ac489)
- [OxF: Reflecting on Founder Mode](https://share.transistor.fm/s/07648e31) ("ego con")
